oh don't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me
I said "you're holding back"
she said "SHUT UP AND DANCE with me"
this woman is my destiny
she said "oo oo!
SHUT UP AND DANCE with me"
we were victims of the night
the chemical physical kryptonite
helpless to the boss and the fading light
we were bound to get together,
bound to get together
she took my arm
I don't know how it happened
we took the floor and she said...
oh don't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me
I said "you're holding back"
she said "SHUT UP AND DANCE with me"
this woman is my destiny
she said "oo oo!
SHUT UP AND DANCE with me"
a backless dress and some beat-up sneaks
my discotech Juliet teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew - we were bound to be together,
bound to be together
she took my arm
I don't know how it happened
we took the floor and she said...
oh don't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me
I said "you're holding back"
she said "SHUT UP AND DANCE with me"
this woman is my destiny
she said "oo oo!
SHUT UP AND DANCE with me..."
oh c'mon girl!
deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize
this is my last chance
she took my arm
I don't know how it happened
we took the floor and she said...
